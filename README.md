Jupiter Ascending is a 2015 space opera film[5] written, directed and co-produced by the Wachowskis. Starring Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis with Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne and Douglas Booth as co-stars, the film is centered on Jupiter Jones (Kunis), an ordinary cleaning woman, and Caine Wise (Tatum), an alien warrior who informs Jones that her destiny extends beyond Earth. Supporting cast member Douglas Booth has described the film's fictional universe as a cross between The Matrix and Star Wars,[6][7][8].

## Plot / Story

A young woman discovers her destiny as an heiress of intergalactic royalty, the owner of the EArth, and must fight to protect the inhabitants of Earth from an ancient and destructive industry. Her brother wants to kill her. Jupiter Jones was born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things, but her life soon becomes dangerous.

The film was produced by Grant Hill and the Wachowskis, making Jupiter Ascending Hill's seventh collaboration with the Wachowskis as producer or executive producer. Several more longstanding Wachowski collaborators since the creation of the Matrix films have contributed to the picture,[13] including production designer Hugh Bateup, visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, visual effects designer John Gaeta, standby propman Alex Boswell, supervising sound editor Dane Davis and costume designer Kym Barrett. Other notable past collaborators include Speed Racer composer Michael Giacchino, Cloud Atlas director of photography John Toll along with its editor Alexander Berner and hair and make-up designer Jeremy Woodhead, who worked on both.

Jupiter Ascending was released in the United States on February 6, 2015, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews from critics; while the visual effects, plot and themes were praised, it was criticized for the writing, lack of character development, some of the performances, and excessive dialogue. It grossed $183 million against a $176â€“210 million budget during its theatrical release, making it a box-office bomb.
